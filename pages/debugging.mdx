# Debugging Tools in mev-commit Node

As the mev-commit node is under active development, it includes debugging tools for in-depth analysis. These tools, primarily intended for developers and not for everyday users, offer insights into the node's functionality. They are accessible via the HTTP API endpoint.

## Understanding Network Topology

You can view the network's topology as recognized by the mev-commit node at the `/topology` endpoint. This provides information such as the number of connected nodes and their roles, helping to ensure your node is well-connected within the network.

Example of Topology Data:

```json
{
  "self": {
    "Addresses": [
      "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/13522",
      "/ip4/172.28.0.4/tcp/13522"
    ],
    "Ethereum Address": "0xB61545548948E9299Ce6eb4C01F2C31FcE6c9E83",
    "Peer Type": "user",
    "Underlay": "16Uiu2HAmNMdhYW6KdECZSNoCseM4cwKbV72BgCYZMz9SbMmxWScM"
  },
  "connected_peers": {
    "providers": [
      "0x6c27a32189016bde0d4a506805aa2b6c46295e8a"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Prometheus Metrics for Monitoring

The node emits various Prometheus metrics, which can be utilized to create dashboards displaying the node's statistics. These include default metrics from the `libp2p` networking library and are available at the `/metrics` endpoint.

## Pprof Endpoints

For advanced users, pprof endpoints are available at `/debug/pprof` for performance profiling, such as monitoring memory and CPU usage. However, understanding and using these endpoints requires prior knowledge of pprof tools and is not covered in this documentation.
