# Quickstart Guide for mev-commit CLI

## Getting Started with the CLI

mev-commit software operates as a command-line interface (CLI) tool, designed for users to run in their own environments. The CLI mainly includes two commands. To view available commands, use the `-h` or `--help` option with the main command.

Example:

```
❯ mev-commit -h
NAME:
   mev-commit - Entry point for mev-commit

USAGE:
   mev-commit [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   "v1.0.0-alpha-a834960"

COMMANDS:
   start       Start the mev-commit node
   create-key  Create a new ECDSA private key and save it to a file
   help, h     Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help
   --version, -v  print the version
```

## Generating ECDSA Private Key

Bidders have the option to either use an existing ECDSA private key or generate a new one using the `create-key` command. This key is essential as it derives the Ethereum address of the node participating in the network.

Example:

```
❯ mev-commit create-key -h
NAME:
   mev-commit create-key - Create a new ECDSA private key and save it to a file

USAGE:
   mev-commit create-key [command options] <output_file>

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```
## Configuration File Setup

To run a node, users need to create a configuration file in YAML format. Example config files are available in the [config](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/tree/main/config) folder. The important options are defined below:

```yaml
# Path to private key file.
priv_key_file: ~/.mev-commit/keys/nodekey

# Type of peer. Options are provider and user.
peer_type: provider

# Port used for P2P traffic. If not configured, 13522 is the default.
p2p_port: 13522

# Port used for HTTP traffic. If not configured, 13523 is the default.
http_port: 13523

# Port used for RPC API. If not configured, 13524 is the default.
rpc_port: 13524

# Secret for the node. This is used to authorize the nodes. The value doesnt matter as long as it is sufficiently unique. It is signed using the private key.
secret: hello

# Format used for the logs. Options are "text" or "json".
log_fmt: text

# Log level. Options are "debug", "info", "warn" or "error".
log_level: debug

# Bootnodes used for bootstrapping the network.
bootnodes:
  - /ip4/35.91.118.20/tcp/13522/p2p/16Uiu2HAmAG5z3E8p7o19tEcLdGvYrJYdD1NabRDc6jmizDva5BL3

# The default is set to false for development reasons. Change it to true if you wish to accept bids on your provider instance
expose_provider_api: false
```

Place this config file in a folder, preferably in a newly created `.mev-commit` folder in the home directory. Once this is done, users can start the node using the `start` command.

Example:

```
❯ mev-commit start -h
NAME:
   mev-commit start - Start the mev-commit node

USAGE:
   mev-commit start [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --config value  path to config file [$MEV_COMMIT_CONFIG]
   --help, -h      show help
```

## Using Docker

Alternatively, users can use the Docker images to run the client in their Docker environment. You need to ensure the node can communicate with other provider or user nodes.
